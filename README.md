Localization and notification service of public works that are in public places in the city of Barcelona

The present work creates de bases of a localization and notification service of public works that are in public places in the city of Barcelona, 
making use of a mobile application. In order to do that, it firstly shows and evaluates the data that’s available. 
This allows to know the data’s reach and to proceed to treat them in a way that can be used to serve the final goal. 
The process starts from filtering the data, to its later use through the digital image processing. 
Once the data has been processed it will be integrated in the application and the alert system will be created.
